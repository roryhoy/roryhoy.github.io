							Rory Hoy is a PhD student in Digital Media, and a researcher in the DisPerSion Lab at York University, Toronto, Canada. <br><br>
							His work is aimed at the crossroads between sonic ecosystems, agent simulation, telematic music, and human/machine collaboration. <br>
							Exploring the musical potential of artificial life systems, his work places performers alongside virtual beings inspired by natural processes to investigate resulting perceptual and performative outcomes of their interplay. <br><br>
							Rory's past conference paper publications have investigated extensions to Deep Listening practices including non-human participants (CMMR 19), and methodologies for networked musical performance in the wake of the global pandemic (Audio Mostly 21). <br><br>
							His performance practice considers timbral movement through noise, the architectural potential of sound through mapping sonic content to space, <br> and subsonic frequency through a processed and extended bass guitar setup, which is honed as an active member of the Doug Van Nort Electro-Acoustic Orchestra. <br> <br>
							Rory holds both an MA and BA Hons in Digital Media from York University.
